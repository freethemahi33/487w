Student database homework using Python 3 with tkinter for GUI and sqlite for db management

Screen shots are of each different frame.

Screenshot 1: Login frame to the database
  Login: admin
  Password: password

Screenshot 2: Successful login with the option to either search for a user by first and last name or insert using first and last name. Upon insertion,
a timestamp is inserted into the datefield and used as a primary key for the database

Screenshot 3: Unsuccessful login with the option to try again

Screenshot 4: Search results for query.

Screenshot 5: Search for a user that does not exist

Notes: Working with sqlite and tkinter was hard to manage the layout of elements and was hard to troubleshoot. This was a first time for me using
tkinter for a GUI, and probably wont do so again... In the past I have found JavaFX and JavaSwing to be much more ideal.
